# Defect_Detection_Through_Computer_Vision

I served as a dedicated Machine Learning Intern within an innovative team working on the "Metal Surface Defect Detection through Machine Learning" project at India's only Smart factory at one the prestigious institutes "The Indian Institute of Science". My primary responsibilities encompassed the development and refinement of a cutting-edge computer vision system that harnessed the Yolov8 algorithm for object detection. In this capacity, I excelled at custom data preprocessing, meticulously fine-tuning models, and optimizing the system to achieve exceptional accuracy in detecting and classifying six distinct metal surface defects: crazing, rolled, patches, pitted, inclusion, and scratches. My efforts contributed significantly to enhancing quality control processes in our smart factory, effectively demonstrating the immense potential of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks in revolutionizing metal product quality assurance. This role provided me with the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the manufacturing industry while pushing the boundaries of computer vision technology.
